## Introduction

This repository is dedicated to providing a resource for learning and understanding fundamental concepts in data structures and algorithms. Whether you are a beginner looking to grasp the basics or an experienced programmer seeking a refresher, you'll find valuable information here.

## Data Structures

In this section, you'll find detailed explanations and implementations of various data structures including:

- Arrays
- Linked Lists
- Stacks
- Queues
- Trees (Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, AVL Trees, etc.)
- Graphs
- Hash Tables
- Heaps
- Along with Advanced Data Structures
- and more...

Each data structure comes with explanations of its properties, operations, time complexity analysis, and practical examples.

## Algorithms

This section covers a wide range of algorithms, including:

- Sorting Algorithms (Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc.)
- Searching Algorithms (Linear Search, Binary Search, etc.)
- Graph Algorithms (BFS, DFS, Shortest Path Algorithms, etc.)
- Dynamic Programming
- and more...

For each algorithm, you'll find detailed explanations, pseudocode, time complexity analysis, and implementation in various programming languages.
